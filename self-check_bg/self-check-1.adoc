Кои от следните са валидни Паскал идентификатори?

[source]
----
birthday        case                CaseNumber
TooHot?         First_Initial       3rdValue
-Number         OldName             downto.what
'grade'         1Program            Beginning

Not too many of these are valid — only _birthday_, _CaseNumber_, _OldName_, and
_Beginning_ may be used correctly, _case_ is tempting, but it’s a reserved word.

Written correctly, the program would be:
[source,pascal]
----
program PrintPaper (output);                          {line 1}
begin                                                 {line 2}
  write (To think that two and two are four, ');      {line 3}
  writeln ('and neither five or three, ');            {line 4}
  write (The heart of man has long been sore ');      {line 5}
  writeln ('and long ''tis like to be.')              {line 6}
end.                                                  {line 7}
