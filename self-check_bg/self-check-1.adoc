Кои от следните са валидни Паскал идентификатори?

[source]
----
birthday        case                CaseNumber
TooHot?         First_Initial       3rdValue
-Number         OldName             downto.what
'grade'         1Program            Beginning
----

Not too many of these are valid — only _birthday_, _CaseNumber_, _OldName_, and
_Beginning_ may be used correctly, _case_ is tempting, but it’s a reserved word.

program Print.Paper (output;)                         {line 1}
begin;                                                {line 2}
  write ('To think that two and two are four, );      {line 3}
  writln (and neither five or three, );               {line 4}
  write ('The heart of man has long been sore';       {line 5}
  write ('and long 'tis like to be.')                 {line 6}
end                                                   {line 7}

Written correctly, the program would be:
[source,pascal]

program PrintPaper (output);                          {line 1}
begin                                                 {line 2}

Write these numbers as Pascal reals. 

[grid=none]
|===
|a) 341,234    |b) .234       |c) 234.73456
|d) 88         |e) .008562    |f) -9427.003
|g) 10^14^     |h) -50        |i) 12.500
|===

Notice that conventionally there’s only one digit before the decimal in floating-
point notation.

[grid=none]
|===
|a) 3.41234E+05 |b) 2.34E-01  |c) 2.3473456E+02
|d) 8.8E+01     |e) 8.562E-03 |f) -9.427003E+03
|g) 1.0E+14     |h) -5.0E+01  |i) 1.25E+01
